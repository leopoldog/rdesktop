# Automated test suite

An basic test suite was added while implementing the dynamic resize
feature. Improvements to this test suite are very welcome.


## Requirements

In addition to the build requirements of rdesktop itself, you also need:

 * [cgreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen)


## Building and running the tests

    cd tests
    make

This will build and run each test in turn. Re-running `make` will
recompile the tests as necessary, and run them again.


## Cgreen documentation

You can find the Cgreen documentation over
at [their github site](https://cgreen-devs.github.io).
